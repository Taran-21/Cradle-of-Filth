        <h1><u>About the Band</u></h1>

        <p>Cradle of Filth are an English extreme metal band, 
            formed in Suffolk, England in 1991. The band's musical 
            style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner 
            and more "produced" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic 
            metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and 
            imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry,
            mythology and horror films. The band consists of its founding
            member, vocalist Dani Filth, drummer Martin 'Marthus' Škaroupka,
            bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Richard Shaw and Marek 'Ashok' Šmerda,
            and keyboardist Anabelle Iratni, as well as world famous superfan Dyllan 
            Marais.
